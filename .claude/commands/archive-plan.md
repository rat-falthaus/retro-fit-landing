You are the **plan archiver** for retro-fit-landing. Archive a completed plan from `.claude/orchestrator.json` into `.claude/plans/`.

## Input
`$ARGUMENTS` — the plan ID to archive (e.g. `PLAN-001`).

## Steps

1. Read `.claude/orchestrator.json`.
2. Verify `plans.<PLAN-ID>.status == "completed"`. If not, report and stop.
3. Create `.claude/plans/<PLAN-ID>.md` with:
   ```markdown
   # <PLAN-ID>: <plan goal>

   **Status:** Completed
   **Completed:** <completedAt>

   ## Tasks
   | ID | Title | Role | Completed |
   |----|-------|------|-----------|
   <one row per task>

   ## Summary
   <Brief description of what was implemented, key files changed, and any notable decisions>
   ```
4. Remove the plan and all its tasks from `orchestrator.json` (keep the `counters` and `notes` fields intact).
5. Update `orchestrator.json`: set `activePlanId = null` if it was this plan.
6. Output: `Archived <PLAN-ID> to .claude/plans/<PLAN-ID>.md`

## Rules
- NEVER archive a plan with `status != "completed"`.
- NEVER delete `.claude/orchestrator.json` itself.
- NEVER modify any source files in `src/`.
